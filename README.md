I actually set out to improve my Rust skills by writing a game (and I'd only learned Rust in the first place because Myles told me to). I had a grand vision for an 8-bit retro platformer. I even drew out the characters on paper. I just needed a way to turn them into sprites. There was nothing necessarily wrong with existing sprite editors; I simply realized that it would be more fun, and educational, to write my own. So I did.
